One thing to remember is that the problem might be even more complex than terrestrial traffic control because this scenario needs to work in three dimensions while automobile traffic only travels in two dimensions. In 2021, the Sumitomo Corporation in Japan  formed a Quantum Transformation Project (QX-PJ) to research this problem and has now turned to PASQAL in what is called “Quantum Sky” to see how PASQAL’s system can run the necessary calculations. Previously, the QX-PJ project used a quantum annealer for the calculations but now they will explore using the PASQAL processor using both analog and digital mode to see if it can accomplish the tasks any better.

One of the subprojects of this endeavor is called QuantiCom Q2H which is intended to demonstrate the use of quantum computing for performing atomic level simulations of molecules. ParityQC has won a three year contract that goes through 2026 to develop quantum algorithms for performing these simulations and will start with two small molecules, hydrogen and water. Once they have developed a quantum based simulation algorithm, they will then compare the results with current classicalal HPC (high performance computing) methods to determine if the quantum approach can provide better results. It is hoped that the new algorithms resulting from this research can be then applied in the future to the more complex types of materials used in aircraft and spacecraft that are of high interest at DLR. Advances that help development of lighter, stronger, and more durable materials are always welcome in the aerospace industry, particularly if they can also be produced at a lower cost.

The company’s approach incorporates redundancy into every logical qubit, reducing the number of physical qubits required for error correction once scaled. This makes their quantum computers highly efficient and scalable, potentially reaching fault-tolerance in a shorter time. The company has also demonstrated the ability to correct both bit-flips and phase-flips, the most common types of errors in quantum computing, by applying GKP bosonic codes for error correction at the individual qubit level.

D-Wave indicates that the Advantage2 architecture has several significant improvements over their original Advantage architecture including an increase in qubit connectivity from 15 to 20, a multilayer superconducting integrated-circuit fabrication stack, a doubling of qubit coherence time, faster time to solution, and a 40% higher energy scale to deliver higher quality solutions. Further, they indicate that even though this prototype features fewer qubits than their current 5000 qubit Advantage2, it can provide better performance for many problems. Although this prototype machine is just a stepping stone to their ultimate goal of having a 7000 qubit Advantage2, the company has decided to make the machine available to their end users via the Leap Quantum Cloud Service so that the end users can take early advantage of its increased capabilities. The company has released a press release announcing the availability of this machine which you can access here .</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.dwavesys.com/company/newsroom/press-release/d-wave-announces-availability-of-1-200-qubit-advantage2-prototype/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>IonQ Renews Alliance with South Korea’s Sungkyunkwan University</title><link>https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240213953989/en/IonQ-and-South-Korea%E2%80%99s-Sungkyunkwan-University-Renew-International-Quantum-Alliance</link><description>IonQ has renewed its alliance with South Korea’s Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) to continue providing access to IonQ’s trapped-ion quantum systems through SKKU’s Q Center .

Like any optical network, the bit rate will drop with distance. So although they were able transmit a QKD key over a 1707 kilometer line, the bit rate drop dramatically to 0.9 bits per second. To put this another way, at 0.9 bps, it would take about 284 seconds (or about 4.75 minutes) to transmit a 256 bit key that could be used in AES-256.

Tiqker is a cold-atom rubidium based atomic clock that provides long term frequency stability of under 5×10 -15 with low phase noise. This technology would compete with Cesium-133 beam clocks that are widely used in critical frequency standard applications. Uses of such a high accuracy frequency standard include use in navigation systems designed to operate in GPS denied environments, providing an accurate frequency reference, and timing synchronization between data centers, 6G base stations, and backbone networks. The unit is compact and fits into a 3U rack panel and weighs less than 50kg. A press release from Infleqtion announcing this delivery can be seen here . In addition, a web page describing the units can be accessed here along with a data sheet for it is available here .</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://static1.squarespace.com/static/63de94661981f84d0e1b9fc5/t/663975c21700dc45668ebe85/1715041731624/Tiqker+PRIME+Spec+Sheet_5-6.pdf</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>IQM Demonstrates Continued Improvement in Qubit Quality</title><link>https://quantumcomputingreport.com/iqm-demonstrates-continued-improvement-in-qubit-quality/</link><description>IQM has continued with improvements in their qubit technology and have announced new results in their qubit fidelity and qubit coherence times that are competitive with some of the very best results reported in the industry so far.
